# Seed Labs 2.0: Web Security (SQL Injection, CSRF, XSS)

## Introduction

This repository contains the report for practical labs and exercises focused on common web vulnerabilities, including:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Exploiting improper input validation to execute malicious SQL queries.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Forcing authenticated users to perform actions without their consent.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web applications.

The labs are based on these [**Seed Labs 2.0**](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Web/).

## Features

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi) Lab**
   - Understand how SQL injection attacks work.
   - Learn how to bypass authentication and extract sensitive data.
   - Mitigation techniques: Prepared statements, parameterized queries, and input validation.

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Lab**
   - Explore how attackers can force users to perform unintended actions.
   - Create and execute CSRF payloads.
   - Mitigation techniques: CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Lab**
   - Experiment with stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS attacks.
   - Learn to inject scripts to steal cookies, deface pages, or perform malicious actions.
   - Mitigation techniques: Input sanitization, output encoding, and CSP (Content Security Policy).

4. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Guidance on fixing vulnerabilities.
   - Practical examples of secure implementations.
